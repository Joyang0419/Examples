# Solid

## Concept

- solid原則就是個寫code的規範，希望開發者去遵循， 開發出比較容易維護的code，每個字母代表一個原則。
- 單一職責原則-Single Responsibility Principle(SRP): A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.
- 開放封閉原則-Open-Closed Principle(OCP): Software entities … should be open for extension but closed for modification”
- 里氏替換原則-Liskov Substitution Principle(LSP): Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it.
- 介面隔離原則-Interface segregation principle(ISP): Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface
- 依賴反向原則-Dependency Inversion Principle(DIP): Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstraction. 
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions
